According to a theorem of Belyi, an algebraic complex curve can be defined
over the field of algebraic numbers if and only if there exists 
a regular map from it to the projective line branched over only three points. 
By composing such a map with an appropriate fractional linear transformation, 
we may assume that these points are at infinity, 0, and 1. 
Such a rational function is called a Belyi map.

To every Belyi map, we associate its passport, which is a list of ramification
indices at points lying over infinity, 0, and 1. 

In this database, the lists of ramification indices over infinity, 0, and 1 are 
ordered in reverse lexicographic order. To obtain a map with an unordered passport,
compose with an appropriate automorphism of the projective line.
